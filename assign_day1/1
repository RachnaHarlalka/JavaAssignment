Difference between Compilers and interpreters:

Compiler :

1.Compiler scans the whole program in one go.	                                     
2.As it scans the code in one go, the errors (if any) are shown at the end together.	
3.Main advantage of compilers is itâ€™s execution time.	
4.It converts the source code into object code.
5.It does not require source code for later execution.
6.Eg.	C, C++, C# etc.	

Interpreters : 

Interpreter
1.Translates program one statement at a time.
2.Considering it scans code one line at a time, errors are shown line by line.
3.Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object code, it is preferred less.
4.It does not convert source code into object code instead it scans it line by line
5.It requires source code for later execution.
6.Eg.Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc.
